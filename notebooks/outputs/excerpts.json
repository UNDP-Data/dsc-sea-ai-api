Integrating energy efficiency practices to reduce losses across entire range of energy value chain starting from mining and extraction, transformation, transmission and distribution and end use sectors must become a priority for Afghanistan for long term sustainability of resources and providing access to clean energy for everyone. Energy efficiency in Afghanistan is regarded as an embryonic subject matter presently for policy makers as well as wider population, resulting in various levels of challenges in bringing about necessary changes in social and institutional landscape to carry out policy reforms related to energy efficiency. This energy efficiency policy is a timely initiative that provides a direction to energy efficiency activities in the country by",
